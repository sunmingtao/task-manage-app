# Task Manager App - Development Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (Week 1)

### Backend Setup
- Initialize Django project with virtual environment
- Configure Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- Set up PostgreSQL database (or SQLite for development)
- Create basic project structure with apps: accounts, boards, tasks
- Configure CORS for React frontend communication

### Frontend Setup
- Create React app with Create React App or Vite
- Set up routing with React Router
- Install UI library (Material-UI, Tailwind, or Ant Design)
- Configure Axios for API calls
- Set up basic folder structure for components, pages, services

## Phase 2: User Authentication (Week 2)

### Django Backend
- Create User model extensions if needed
- Implement JWT authentication with Django REST Framework
- Build registration, login, logout API endpoints
- Add password reset functionality

### React Frontend
- Create login/register forms
- Implement authentication context for state management
- Add protected routes
- Build user profile page
- Handle token storage and refresh

## Phase 3: Core Data Models (Week 3)

### Django Models
- Board model (workspace/project container)
- List model (columns like "To Do", "In Progress", "Done")
- Task model (individual tasks with descriptions, due dates, priorities)
- Set up model relationships and permissions

### API Development
- Create serializers for all models
- Build CRUD endpoints for boards, lists, and tasks
- Add filtering and search capabilities
- Implement proper permissions (users can only access their boards)

## Phase 4: Basic UI Implementation (Week 4)

### React Components
- Dashboard showing user's boards
- Board view with lists displayed horizontally
- Task cards within lists
- Forms for creating/editing boards, lists, and tasks
- Basic responsive design

### State Management
- Set up Context API or Redux for global state
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Handle loading states and error messages

## Phase 5: Drag & Drop Functionality (Week 5)

### Frontend Enhancement
- Integrate React DnD or react-beautiful-dnd
- Enable dragging tasks between lists
- Add drag indicators and visual feedback
- Update backend when tasks are moved
- Handle drag and drop for reordering within lists

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Week 6-7)

### Enhanced Task Management
- Task assignments (if building team features)
- Due dates with calendar integration
- Priority levels and color coding
- Task descriptions with rich text editor
- File attachments
- Comments on tasks

### Board Collaboration
- Invite users to boards
- Different permission levels (viewer, editor, admin)
- Real-time updates with WebSockets (Django Channels)

## Phase 7: Polish & Deployment (Week 8)

### Final Touches
- Comprehensive error handling
- Loading skeletons and animations
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Performance optimization

### Deployment
- Deploy Django backend (Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS)
- Deploy React frontend (Netlify, Vercel, or same server)
- Set up production database
- Configure environment variables
- Add monitoring and logging

## Key Technologies You'll Learn

### Django Side
- Django REST Framework
- JWT authentication
- Database relationships and migrations
- API design patterns
- Django Channels (for real-time features)

### React Side
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- React Router for navigation
- State management patterns
- HTTP requests with Axios
- Drag and drop libraries
- Form handling and validation

## Recommended Learning Approach

Start with a minimal viable product in phases 1-4, then gradually add complexity. Focus on getting the basic CRUD operations working before adding drag-and-drop and real-time features.
